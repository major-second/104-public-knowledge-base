- AI看起来相比物理更加新兴，更多坑
## 1.1 What Is AI?
- human vs. rational
  - 人的决策不一定总是完美
> The various groups have both disparaged and helped each other.

### Acting humanly
- human-like: Turing test
  - NLP
  - knowledge representation：明白听到了什么

Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making “machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool even other pigeons.”
