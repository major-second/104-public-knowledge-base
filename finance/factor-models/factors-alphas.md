  - [[CAPM]], [[fama-french]]
- "Alpha" is a measure of the excess return of a security or portfolio over its expected return, given its exposure to various factors
  - ref: [[CAPM#Alphas]]
  - In other words, alpha represents the portion of a security's return that cannot be explained by its exposure to the factors **in the model**
  - In [[CAPM]], those additional factors in [[fama-french]] are alphas ([[data-science/residual]])
