  - [[naming]]
- A "factor" represents a systematic risk that affects the returns of a security or portfolio.
  - Factor models help in estimating the expected returns and risks of a security or portfolio.
  - Factors can be macroeconomic variables, market indices, or other financial variables that influence asset prices.

  - Concrete examples: [[barra#CNE5]]
- "Alpha" is a measure of the excess return of a security or portfolio over its expected return, given its exposure to various factors
  - ref: [[CAPM#Alphas]]
  - In other words, alpha represents the portion of a security's return that cannot be explained by its exposure to the factors **in the model**
  - In [[CAPM]], those additional factors in [[fama-french]] could be alphas ([[data-science/residual]])
  - "Signal" is often synonym of "Alpha"
