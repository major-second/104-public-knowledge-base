- Prerequisites
  - [[apt]]
  - [[cpp-helloworld]]
- Install `g++`
  - [Reference](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/476988995)
    - > Usually comes pre-installed
    - Can also be installed manually
    - Use `sudo apt update && sudo apt install g++` to install
    - Use `g++ -v` to check the [[version]]
- Usage
  - `g++ <file>.cpp -o test` to compile the program, `./test` to run it
  - Therefore,
    - Modifying the source code does not immediately cause changes like in [[python]]. It needs to be recompiled
    - Unlike [[shell]], it is not possible to make changes to the code while it is running
      - [[online]]
  - Flags
    - Optimization level: Recommended to use `-O2`
    - `-g`: Enables [[gdb]] for [[cpp-debug]]
