- the whole economy, big stuff, booms and busts
- history: new subject: Great Depression 1930s
- do predictions, but different answers, subjective
  - unpredictable, hard to control variables
- goals of policy makers:
  - keep the economy growing over time
    - GDP (Gross Domestic Product)
  - limit unemployment
    - unemployment rate
  - keep prices stable
    - inflation rate
# GDP
- the value of all final **goods and services** produced **within a country's border** in a specific period of time
- buy stocks / domestic used car / another company: nothing new is produced, not count towards GDP
- illegal / household production: not count
- in dollars: problem: inflation
  - nominal -> real (adjusted for inflation)
- decrease, recession
  - recession: definition: 2 quarters / 6 months show a decrease in real GDP
  - depression: really bad, severe recession
- other problems of GDP
  - different definitions: EU, underground?
- GDP's history: also not so long
  - during the Great Depression: stock price, freight car loadings, incomplete indices of industrial production
  - invented to account for national income, not a complete picture for ..., but for the moment it's what we've got
# unemployment rate
- actively looking for a job but just can't find one
  - denominator: labor force
  - legal working age, working / actively looking for work
  - 摆烂: discouraged workers, don't count towards the denominator
  - 不考虑underemployed (part-time?) 问题
- 3 reasons
  - friction: temporarily. e.g. searching for jobs
  - structural: mismatch of demand and supply
    - always exist!
    - natural rate of unemployment, U.S. 4% ~ 6%
  - cyclical: can be eliminated (compared to the previous two), due to recession, stop to buy...
- GDP ↑, unemployment ↓
# inflation rate
- cheaper: bad. e.g. Greece, Great Depression
- price of a "basket". ratio of ... over time
- too much inflation: higher wages, cost increases, higher interest rates, harder loans
- deflation: discourage people to buy things, GDP↓, unemployment↑, vicious cycle
  - accompanied severe recessions
# business cycle
- GDP, unemployment, inflation: gauges
- cycle
  - too fast: overheat, expansion
  - unemployment falls, demand increases, outbid each other, inflation, higher wages, cost increases
  - contraction, slow down, lay off, spend less, less demand, resources (like labor force) are sitting idle, cost falls, expand again
  - booms and busts
- engines:
  - consumption
    - heavily depends, e.g. U.S. 70%
  - investment
  - government spending
  - net exports (spending by other countries)
  - different ratio -> different modes, status
- cruise mode like driving a car?
  - government should play a role
  - e.g. recession -> increase spending or cut taxes
    - drawbacks: debt
