# DST
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time)
- > Daylight saving time (DST), also referred to as daylight savings time, daylight time (United States, Canada, and Australia), or summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and others)
  - “夏令时冬令时”
  - 与standard time 相对
- 逻辑：
  - > The idea of **aligning waking hours** to daylight hours to conserve candles was first proposed in 1784 by U.S. polymath Benjamin Franklin. In a satirical letter to the editor of The Journal of Paris, Franklin suggested that waking up earlier in the summer would economize on candle usage; and calculated considerable savings.
  - 8点天亮 (`darkness falls`) -> 7点天亮，人们习惯点灯到8点，浪费？ -> 调整，还是8点天亮
- Take ET (Eastern Time) as an example
  - [ET wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone)
  - Recall: EST UTC-5, EDT UTC-4
  - > On the second Sunday in March, at 2:00 a.m. EST, clocks are advanced to 3:00 a.m. EDT leaving a one-hour gap. On the first Sunday in November, at 2:00 a.m. EDT, clocks are moved back to 1:00 a.m. EST, which results in one hour being duplicated. Southern parts of the zone in Panama and the Caribbean, however, do not observe daylight saving time.
