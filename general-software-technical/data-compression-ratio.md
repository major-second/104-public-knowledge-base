- [The data compression ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio)
  - a measure of the reduction in data size due to compression. It is calculated as the ratio of the uncompressed size to the compressed size.
  - For example, if a 1GB file is compressed to 200MB, the data compression ratio is 5:1, meaning the compressed file is 1/5th the size of the original file.
  - However, it's important to note that not all files can be compressed to the same degree. Some files, such as those already in a compressed format like `.jpg` or `.mp3`, may not see significant size reduction with further compression. This is because these files have already been optimized to reduce size without significant loss of information.
  - Therefore, when dealing with these types of files, it's important to consider the trade-off between the computational resources required for further compression and the potential reduction in file size.
