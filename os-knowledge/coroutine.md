- Coroutine is a control unit at the compiler level, also known as user-level thread, which is completely scheduled within the user state of the process.
- Comparison: Process and Thread (accurately, kernel-level thread) are control units at the operating system level, scheduled by the OS.
  - ref: [[process-thread]]
- Coroutine implements non-preemptive scheduling, that is, a process contains multiple coroutines. Within the time slice when the process is scheduled by the OS, the internal scheduler of the process schedules a certain coroutine to run, and each coroutine actively blocks itself to yield CPU time.
- Advantages: Reduces the overhead of thread scheduling and the memory overhead of creating threads, and reduces the overhead of synchronization and locking.
